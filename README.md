# genetic-algorithm-deliveries
We want to implement a Genetic Algorithm for delivering orders in an efficient way. We have a list of clients who have ordered different items with different weights. Our goal is to deliver as many items as possible using the shortest path possible starting at the warehouse. Our constraint is that the vehicle for delivering has a maximum capacity.
